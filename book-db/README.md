Useful script to learn:
- open() and close() methods to work with files
- work with json files (dump and load, mainly):
  - the script loads a json file into a variable (type: list - list of dictionaries)
  - then appends to the list a new entry (a new dictionary)
  - then saves (dumps) the list of dictionaries in a json format
